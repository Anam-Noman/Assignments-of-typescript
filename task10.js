//Assignment # 10
//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point,
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.//
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
// Define two numbers 
let number1 = 32;
let number2 = 10;
// Add two numbers
let result = number1 + number2;
// Print result
console.log(result);
export {};
