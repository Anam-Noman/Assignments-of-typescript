// Assignment # 12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
// but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let Names = ["Ana", "Dua", "Abraiz", "Sonia", "Erum"];


Names.forEach(Name => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${Name}! Have a great day!`);
});
